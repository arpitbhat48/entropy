Series contains the series name and the internal vector representation using the [wasml/linalg](https://github.com/wasml/linalg) repository.  

- [SeriesI32](02-seriesi32.md): Used to represent a Series of integers. The
  underlying type used is a 32-bit integer. It supports math operations but
  doesn't support complex statistical operations.
- [SeriesF64](03-seriesf64.md): Used to represent a Series of floats. The underlying
  type used is a 64-bit floating point number. It supports math and statistical
  operations.
- [SeriesSTR](04-seriesstr.md): Used to represent a Series of strings.

:::warning
Other types not supported yet, will be implemented in the
future.
